# CareerBridge-AI-Skill-Gap-Roadmap-Platform
"Discover your skill gaps, get personalized learning roadmaps, and find hackathons &amp; internships to accelerate your career."
Many students and early professionals struggle to identify their skill gaps and don’t know which skills to learn to be job-ready or hackathon-ready. I wanted to create a platform that guides users through their career journey by analyzing their current skills, suggesting personalized learning roadmaps, and recommending hackathons and internships based on their domain.

What I Learned

Full-stack development with FastAPI backend and interactive JS frontend.

Integrating maps with Leaflet.js to visualize nearby learning centers and hackathons.

Designing dynamic dashboards to show skill gaps, roadmaps, and scores.

User authentication, data handling, and asynchronous API calls.

How I Built It

Frontend: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build responsive, clean, and interactive UI/UX.

Backend: FastAPI in Python to calculate skill gaps, generate roadmap, and serve API endpoints.

Dashboard: Shows skills entered, missing skills, suggested roadmap, and domain-specific hackathons.

Map Integration: Leaflet.js to mark nearby learning centers and hackathons.

Skill Analysis: Backend logic calculates readiness score and categorizes skills into must, core, and advanced.

Challenges Faced

Handling dynamic skill input and mapping to multiple domains.

Displaying data visually without overwhelming the user.

Ensuring frontend and backend synchronization for smooth dashboard experience.

Making the UI clean, attractive, and responsive for various devices.

Built With

Languages & Frameworks: Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Libraries & APIs: Leaflet.js (maps), Fetch API (frontend-backend communication)

Deployment/Hosting: Local development (can be extended to Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify)

Data: In-memory storage for demo purposes
